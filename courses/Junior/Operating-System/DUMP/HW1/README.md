# File Copy Program

This is a simple C program that copies files from a source to a destination. The program allows users to specify source and destination file names, handles file existence checks, and prompts users for actions when the destination file already exists.

## Features

- **File Copying**: Efficiently copies the contents of a source file to a destination file.
- **User Prompts**: Prompts for user input to handle existing files and allows quitting the program.
- **Robust Input Handling**: Ensures user inputs are handled safely to avoid crashes.
