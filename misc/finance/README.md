# Classic Trading Principles

1. **Hold as long as conditions are favorable**: If the stock and the market are acting right, don’t rush to take profits.
2. **Exit when the trend reverses**: End trades once it's clear that the profitable trend is over.
3. **Avoid relying on tips**: Focus on research rather than outside tips.
4. **Wait for confirmation**: Only enter a trade after the market’s movement confirms your opinion, and act promptly.
5. **Trust the market, question your opinions**: Markets are rarely wrong, but opinions often are.

# Jesse Livermore's Principles
Jesse Livermore, one of the most famous stock traders of the early 20th century, developed a trading approach that focused on timing, patience, and psychology. Here’s a breakdown of Livermore’s key principles:

1. **Trade with the Trend**: Livermore believed in buying stocks when the market was rising and selling or shorting when the market was falling. He followed what he called "pivotal points" to identify trends early and ride them until they lost momentum.

2. **Only Trade Leading Stocks**: He preferred to trade in the most actively traded and market-leading stocks, as they had the strongest trends. By focusing on leaders, he could leverage larger price movements.

3. **Wait for the Market to Confirm Your Theory**: Livermore avoided speculation based on opinion alone. He would only enter a position after the market began to confirm his analysis, avoiding impulsive actions and waiting until there was evidence of a shift.

4. **Pyramid into Positions Carefully**: When adding to a winning position, Livermore would "pyramid" by adding to his positions in increments, rather than buying everything at once. This strategy allowed him to take advantage of increasing trends while managing risk.

5. **Avoid Overtrading**: Livermore was cautious about trading too frequently, believing in quality over quantity. He looked for “big swings” and aimed to capture substantial parts of market trends rather than short-term fluctuations.

6. **Don’t Average Down**: He was firmly against adding to losing positions. Instead, he would cut his losses quickly to preserve capital for better opportunities.

7. **Keep Emotions in Check**: Livermore acknowledged the emotional side of trading and emphasized discipline and self-control. He avoided making decisions based on greed, fear, or hope, sticking strictly to his trading rules.

8. **Be Patient and Avoid Impulsiveness**: He often stressed the importance of patience, noting that some of his best trades were a result of waiting for the right moment, sometimes even sitting out of the market if it didn’t meet his criteria.
