To display dynamic bus information in Taiwan using an ESP32 and an LCD screen, you can follow these steps:

### Components Needed
- ESP32 Development Board: A versatile microcontroller with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities.
- LCD Screen: An I2C LCD (such as a 16x2 or 20x4) is recommended for simplicity.
- Jumper Wires: For connecting the LCD to the ESP32.
- Power Supply: USB power supply for the ESP32.

### Setting Up the Hardware
1. Connect the LCD to the ESP32:
- Use the I2C protocol to connect the LCD. Typically, connect:
    VCC of the LCD to 3.3V on the ESP32.
    GND of the LCD to GND on the ESP32.
    SDA (data line) of the LCD to a GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO 21).
    SCL (clock line) of the LCD to another GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO 22)

2. Circuit Diagram: Create a simple schematic showing these connections for clarity.

### Programming the ESP32
1. Install Required Libraries:
- Use libraries such as Wire.h for I2C and LiquidCrystal_I2C.h for controlling the LCD. These can be installed via the Arduino IDE Library Manager.
2. Write Code to Display Bus Information:
    Here is a basic example code snippet that initializes the LCD and displays dynamic bus information:

```cpp
#include <Wire.h>
#include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h>

// Initialize the LCD with I2C address 0x27 (common for 16x2 displays)
LiquidCrystal_I2C lcd(0x27, 16, 2);

void setup() {
    lcd.begin();
    lcd.backlight(); // Turn on backlight
    lcd.setCursor(0, 0);
    lcd.print("Bus No: 123");
    lcd.setCursor(0, 1);
    lcd.print("Arriving in 5 min");
}

void loop() {
    // Here you would typically fetch real-time data from a bus API
    // For demonstration, we are just updating static text
    delay(10000); // Update every 10 seconds
    lcd.clear();
    lcd.setCursor(0, 0);
    lcd.print("Bus No: 456");
    lcd.setCursor(0, 1);
    lcd.print("Arriving in 3 min");
}
```

2. Fetch Dynamic Data:
    To display real-time bus data, you can use APIs provided by local transport authorities. The ESP32 can make HTTP requests using its Wi-Fi capabilities to fetch this information and update the display accordingly.

### Testing and Troubleshooting
- Once you upload your code to the ESP32, ensure that your connections are secure.
- If the display does not show any text, check your I2C address; it may vary based on your specific LCD module.
- Use a serial monitor to debug any issues related to data fetching or display updates.

By following these steps, you can successfully set up an ESP32 with an LCD screen to display dynamic bus information in Taiwan. This project not only enhances your programming skills but also contributes to creating informative displays for public transport systems.
